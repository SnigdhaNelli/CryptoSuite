# CryptoSuite

> This project implements a small cryptosuite application to demonstrate modular operations (addition,multiplication and exponentiation),GCD, Inverse Modulo, Discrete logarithm (using either Pohlig-Hellman, index calculus, Pollard-rho or the basic Baby Step Giant Step algorithm), RSA cryptosystem and Field Operations in Prime Fields and Binary Fields using the biginteger class in C++.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. Install the package by cloning this repo using the following command.

2. Navigate to the folder containing the main.cpp file. Run the following command to compile the file.

```
g++ main.cpp -o main
```
3. Now run the executable main generated in the src folder using the following command.

```
./main
```
   Now you can use all the functionalities provided by our cryptosuite application.
